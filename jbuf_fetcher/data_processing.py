# Get the data lists 

# Split the data lists by projects 

# for each project : 

    # Compare botavista and directus 

    # Get the collected % 

    # Compare botavista and directus "extracted = true"

    # Get the extracted % 

    # Compare botavista and directus "profiled = true"

    # Get the profiled %

# Create a json with [project, % collected, % extracted, % profiled] (will be use in html_generator)
